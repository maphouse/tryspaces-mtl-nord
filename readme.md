TO-DOs

emory
========================================================================
- welcome splash page...
- add onmouseover highlights/ to map features. as responsive as possible

- have top-middle logo refresh page (i.e. zoom back to default map bounds and slide left pane back in)
- remove changing url with each map feature clicked, instead, have a unique link generated when a user clicks "share vignette"


- symbologie de la carte à travailler

- intégrer l'option de partager la solution sur fb, tweet, (diff url required for each vignette...)

- add link to edit basemap in openstreetmaps 'if you see something that needs changing, contact emory for help'
- add cdn arrondissement polygon and make it a selectable layer from the layers map control

lucas
========================================================================
- !IMPORTANT: re-center off-centered map after left-pane swing-out.
- url containing vignette needs to land directly with left pane open or trigger left pane slide-out immediately
- onclick event on map should only trigger left pane slide when a map feature is clicked, not simply anywhere on basemap
- make scrollbar in left pane always visible so that the arrows dont move around when navigating vignettes

- custom responsive frmwrk (non-bootstrap) (some bugs / issues when on smartphone)
- on smartphone, full screen map
- map interaction slides json content up from bottom, leaving margin of map visible (above)
- interaction with map sliver brings map back again into full screen (sliding content pane down)
- left pane also contains navigation arrows (move arrows from top of page to left pane and add styles)

julien
========================================================================
- make search bar dropdown options vertical (probably to do with styling of parent div ul)
